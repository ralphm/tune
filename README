Rhythmbox Tune Publisher
========================

This little tool connects to Rhythmbox, a GNOME music player, using bonobo
and watches changes to the current state of the player. It publishes
this information to a Jabber pubsub node using the protocol described in
JEP-0118 (User Tune).

Requirements
------------

- Rhythmbox 0.8.5 (earlier versions will probably work, too)
- Twisted Python >= 1.2.0
- Python bindings to GNOME > 2.0.2 [1]

[1] All versions of the Python bindings to GNOME have a bug in the bonobo
    module, that is solved in CVS as of 2004/07/20. If you have a source
	distribution of version 2.0.2 of these bindings, you can patch it using
	the file bonobo.override.patch and reinstall.

Usage
-----

Usage: python tune.py [options]
Options:
  -u, --username=  your Jabber username
  -h, --host=      the Jabber server
  -r, --resource=  the Jabber resource [default: tune_publisher]
      --secret=    your password
  -p, --port=      the Jabber server's port [default: 5222]
  -s, --service=   the pubsub service
  -n, --node=      the pubsub node
      --version
      --help       Display this help and exit.

You need to have access to a pubsub service and have a node already created. I
can provide this for you on request. The only known implementation of an
application that listens for User Tune notifications is the Jabber World Map
at http://ralphm.net/world, and you can also request to have its bot to
subscribe to your User Tune node.

The options --username, --host and --resource define the full JID from which
you will publish. That JID (without resource) should be allowed to publish
to the node described above. This tool will log in with the given JID
without sending presence, and therefore also requires the password for that
account.
